# Changelog-Component
The goal of this project is to help me put into practice the knowledge about positioning and layout in CSS. I create a simple HTML structure and use CSS to style it into a visually appealing and responsive changelog component. The project challenge can be found here https://roadmap.sh/projects/changelog-component

## How to run the project
Clone the repo into your local machine then open changelog.html file.
